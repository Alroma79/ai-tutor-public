# Welcome to the AI Elevator Pitch Tutor! 🚀

This application will help you craft and refine your elevator pitch through interaction with four specialized AI agents. An elevator pitch is a brief, persuasive speech used to spark interest in a project, idea, product, or yourself. A good elevator pitch should last no longer than 30-60 seconds - the time it takes to ride an elevator.

## Your AI Agents 🤖

- 🧑‍🏫 **Mentor Agent**: Guides you step-by-step through the elevator pitch creation process
- 👥 **Peer Agent**: Provides casual feedback like a fellow student would
- 📈 **Progress Agent**: Tracks your progress through the steps
- 📝 **Evaluator Agent**: Reviews and scores your final pitch

## How to Use This Application 📋

1. **Start with the Mentor Agent** (default when you begin)
2. **Follow the guided process** through all five steps of creating an elevator pitch
3. **Switch between agents** using commands:
   - Type `/mentor` to get structured guidance
   - Type `/peer` for casual feedback
   - Type `/progress` to check your current progress
   - Type `/eval` to evaluate your pitch
4. **Submit your pitch** by typing `/upload` or using the 📎 button to attach a PDF or DOCX file
5. **Receive detailed feedback** and a score out of 10

## The Five Steps of an Elevator Pitch 🪜

1. **Problem Identification**: What specific problem does your idea solve?
2. **Solution Overview**: What is your solution to the problem?
3. **Value Proposition**: What makes your idea unique or better than alternatives?
4. **Target Audience**: Who would benefit most from your idea?
5. **Call to Action**: What action do you want your audience to take?

## Tips for Success 💡
